## Solana-Fiat KYC-Free Bridge :handshake:

Welcome to the Solana-Fiat KYC-Free Bridge repository, a community sourced, up-to-date list of platforms and solutions to enable No-KYC conversions between Solana (SOL) and Fiat currency (and vice versa). This initiative aims to curate a guide to help people switch their fiat for crypto and back on their own terms.

## Community Contributions :heart:

This project is all about community contributions! The crypto landscape is vast and is evolving every day. It can be challenging for one person or even a small team to keep up with all the new developments. That's why we're relying on the power of the crowd to help us build and maintain this list.

## Contributing

2. Platform Name
3. URL to the platform
4. A brief description of the platform

The traffic light emoji represents the level of KYC implemented on the platform:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** represents No-KYC platforms. These are platforms where users can freely convert between Solana and Fiat without having to go through identification.
- ðŸŸ  **Orange** signifies platforms that have KYC but with redeeming features. These platforms might have some form of KYC but also offer features that could be of value to some users.
- ðŸ”´ **Red** is a warning. This could be a platform that has strict KYC regulations or other elements that might raise concerns for privacy-seeking users.
